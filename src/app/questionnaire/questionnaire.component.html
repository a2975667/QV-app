	<p *ngIf="questionTitle!='QV Dry Run: Understanding what is Quadratic Voting'">People have different preferences in
		how resources should be allocated for different societal issues. Here we listed 9 different societal issues based on a popular donation website that has accumulated over 100 million dollars of donations. For
		each of the issues listed below, <b> how important do you think the issue is to you and that more effort and resources should be contributed toward the issue? </b></p>
	<p>
		For this question, you will use a <b>Quadratic Voting</b> method to express your preferences.
		<br><br>
		You will be given a budget of a certain number of <b> voice credits</b>. You will use the available credits to
		cast votes. If you think more resources should be allocated to a certain issue, you can cast multiple
		upvotes using the <b>+1 sign</b>. If you believe that less resources should be allocated on a certain
		issue, you can cast a few downvotes using the <b> -1 sign</b>. If you are neutral on an issue, you can choose to
		cast <b> no vote </b>.

		<br><br>
		<b> Based on the intensity of your opinion, you can cast one or more upvote or downvotes for each issue</b>. The
		stronger your opinion is, the more votes you can put on one option. The cost of these additional votes increases quadratically. In other words, <b> X votes will cost X<sup>2</sup> (square of X)
			credits</b>. The table shows the cost for 1 to 10 votes as an example. You can vote more than 10 votes if the voice credit you have allows so.
